Where Used [rds.tf](../aws/rds.tf)

- ```db.m6g``` – General-purpose instance classes powered by AWS Graviton2 processors. These deliver balanced compute, memory, and networking for a broad range a general purpose workloads.

You can modify a DB instance to use one of the DB instance classes powered by AWS Graviton2 processors by completing the same steps as any other DB instance modification.

- ```db.m5d``` – The newest generation instance classes that are optimized for low latency, very high random I/O performance, and high sequential read throughput.

- ```db.m5``` – The latest generation general-purpose instance classes that provide a balance of compute, memory, and network resources, and are a good choice for many applications. The db.m5 instance classes provide more computing capacity than the previous db.m4 instance classes. They are powered by the AWS Nitro System, a combination of dedicated hardware and lightweight hypervisor.

- ```db.m4``` – General-purpose instance classes that provide more computing capacity than the previous db.m3 instance classes.

- ```db.m3``` – General-purpose instance classes that provide more computing capacity than the previous db.m1 instance classes.

- ```db.m1``` – Earlier generation general-purpose instance classes.

The following are the Memory Optimized DB instance classes available:

- ```db.z1d``` – Instance classes optimized for memory-intensive applications. These offer both high compute capacity and a high memory footprint. High frequency z1d instances deliver a sustained all core frequency of up to 4.0 GHz.

- ```db.x1e``` – Instance classes optimized for memory-intensive applications. These offer one of the lowest price per gibibyte (GiB) of RAM among the DB instance classes and up to 3,904 GiB of DRAM-based instance memory.

- ```db.x1``` – Instance classes optimized for memory-intensive applications. These offer one of the lowest price per GiB of RAM among the DB instance classes and up to 1,952 GiB of DRAM-based instance memory.

- ```db.r6g``` – Instance classes powered by AWS Graviton2 processors. These are ideal for running memory-intensive workloads in open-source databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.

You can modify a DB instance to use one of the DB instance classes powered by AWS Graviton2 processors by completing the same steps as any other DB instance modification.

- ```db.r5b``` – Instance classes that are memory-optimized for throughput-intensive applications. Powered by the AWS Nitro System, db.r5b instances deliver up to 60 Gbps bandwidth and 260,000 IOPS of EBS performance, which is the fastest block storage performance on EC2.

- ```db.r5d``` – Instance classes that are optimized for low latency, very high random I/O performance, and high sequential read throughput.

- ```db.r5``` – Latest generation instance classes optimized for memory-intensive applications. These offer improved networking and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) performance. They are powered by the AWS Nitro System, a combination of dedicated hardware and lightweight hypervisor.

- ```db.r4``` – Instance classes optimized for memory-intensive applications. These offer improved networking and Amazon EBS performance.

- ```db.r3``` – Instance classes that provide memory optimization.

- ```db.m2``` – Earlier generation memory-optimized instance classes.

The following are the Burstable Performance DB instance classes available:

- ```db.t3``` – Next generation instance classes that provide a baseline performance level, with the ability to burst to full CPU usage. These instance classes provide more computing capacity than the previous db.t2 instance classes. They are powered by the AWS Nitro System, a combination of dedicated hardware and lightweight hypervisor.

- ```db.t2``` – Instance classes that provide a baseline performance level, with the ability to burst to full CPU usage.
